Title: Personal results will grow and blossom - if you continue to water it.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2017
Review: This book truly resonated with me.
To read "Who Says you can't? You Do" is like making an investment in yourself.

I will recommend everyone to read it (And after first read can be like a handbook to look up in, I definitely want to read this book again. and I even bought a copy for my sister).
So everyone willing to make a positive change in their life, everyone who is wanting to take charge of their own life - by taking action and comitting to stay on the path best for you - to leave that victim role behind and go chase and follow those dreams your heart and soul deeply desires.

This book is a 7 step all round guideline to help you help yourself with insights how to rewire your thought pattern and shifting focus; which the author has established through his own life experiences and what has worked for him.

I also quite enjoy Daniel's way of writing - how he is kinda talking personally to you, the reader, it makes the book have a great energy as you read along it's almost like a friend on an equal level showing you it's worth doing the work and commitment for your own good and backing it up with examples from experiences and every day life.
Enjoy the journey of self-discovery, commit, do the work and stay patient. and results will grow and blossom.

Title: Life Changing Inspirational book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2018
Review: I haven‚Äôt been interested in reading in years. I was in a dark place in my life and quotes from his book on Instagram spoke to me, so I decided to buy his book.

It was even better than I expected! This really helped change my perspective on life and has helped me nearly eliminate all of my self-doubt I‚Äôve had in myself so so long. It also made me think deeper and realize I had been empty and unfulfilled for so long. This book uses great examples and tools to help you change your way of thinking to truely better yourself and your life. I also loved his writing how he talks to you like an old friend. The i inspirational quotes in every section was a great added bonus! Highly recommend!! Life changing!!

If you‚Äôre ready to really think and listen to his advice, you‚Äôre ready to change your life for the better. It‚Äôs really all in your mindset and this book helps you understand to bring it to light!

Review: I would say that this book helped me regain my possitive attitude towards everything in life. If you are craving for motivation the author not only motivates you with words, but it gives you tips and exercise so you can gain confidence in anything you are planing to be your next journey. Is a realistic book with tips that you can apply to yourself if you really want to make your life change. I will read it again as many times as I need.
